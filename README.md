# Overview

This is a translation of the scheme compiler by Marc Feeley to clojure. More details about Marc's compiler can be found in this [presentation](http://churchturing.org/y/90-min-scc.pdf) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp89aBm9tGU).

This is the "first" cut - publishing it right after I got it to work! I will be cleaning this up in the coming days.
